# Catalogue import

## Overview

Turn authoritative ANU source material into idempotent, versioned Coursemap records. Never promote prototype fixtures or inferred values as authoritative catalogue data.

## Workflow

1. Identify the authoritative source URL, catalogue year, retrieval time, licence constraints and source format.
2. Save source metadata and a content hash before transforming records.
3. Parse into typed staging records and validate codes, units, dates, rule structure and references.
4. Upsert through stable natural keys inside a transaction. Do not delete previously published data merely because a source is temporarily incomplete.
5. Send ambiguities, conflicts and unsupported rule expressions to a review queue with the original source fragment.
6. Compare created, changed, unchanged, rejected and missing counts against the previous successful run.
7. Publish only after referential, domain and spot-check validation passes.

## Data rules

- Key course identity separately from year-specific course versions.
- Model teaching periods and offerings explicitly.
- Preserve nested prerequisite logic using rule groups and conditions. Do not flatten `all of`, `any of` and minimum-count rules into a single list.
- Version degree and programme structures independently from a student's plan.
- Track each sync run and record-level source provenance.
- Keep import parsers outside request handlers so they can be tested and rerun safely.

## Verification

- Unit-test each parser with captured fixtures that contain source dates and provenance.
- Check broken course references, duplicate natural keys, impossible units and malformed rule trees.
- Re-run the same input and confirm the second run is a no-op.
- Review a sample of transformed records against the original source before publishing.
- Keep captured test fixtures under `tests/fixtures` with their source dates and provenance; never serve fixture data from the production path.
