# Coursemap database

This directory is the source of truth for Coursemap's Supabase configuration,
forward-only migrations and database tests.

## Project

- Project ref: `mogdmhkqkpvksvtvwdgl`
- Region: Sydney (`ap-southeast-2`)
- Plan: Supabase Free

The hosted development project carries the complete migration history, Row
Level Security policies and the reviewed 2026 structure seed. Day-to-day
development uses the local Supabase stack. Browser-safe local values belong in
`apps/web/.env.local`; service-role keys and database passwords must never be
committed.

## Workflow

```bash
pnpm db:start
pnpm db:reset
pnpm db:test
pnpm db:lint
pnpm db:types
```

Create each schema change with `supabase migration new <name>`. Rebuild locally,
regenerate `apps/web/types/database.ts`, run the database gates, then run
`pnpm verify`. Applying migrations to the hosted project requires explicit
approval and is a separate step.

`seed.sql` intentionally contains no catalogue or user fixtures. `pnpm db:reset` performs an explicitly local reset, then applies the separate preview
fixture through a database client that refuses every non-loopback connection.
Reapply it to an already running local stack with `pnpm db:seed:preview`.
The demonstration catalogue uses explicit mock provenance and separate
`DEMO-*` structure codes. Authoritative catalogue data must still be imported
with source URLs, retrieval metadata and content hashes.

## Administrator access

Application roles live in the private schema and are never inferred from an
email address or editable user metadata. The first administrator must be
bootstrapped from Supabase Studio's SQL editor, replacing the example address:

```sql
insert into private.user_roles (user_id, role_id, granted_by)
select users.id, roles.id, users.id
from auth.users as users
cross join private.app_roles as roles
where users.email = 'developer@example.test'
  and roles.key = 'admin'
on conflict (user_id) do update
set
  role_id = excluded.role_id,
  granted_by = excluded.granted_by,
  granted_at = now();
```

Every new account receives the `User` role. This is the only bootstrap
operation. Afterwards, an admin can open `/admin/users` and switch an account
between `User` and `Admin`. Role permissions are database-managed and editable
from `/admin/roles`. The database prevents admins from changing their own role
or removing the final admin.

## Operational follow-up

Historical local and hosted migration timestamps differ. Preserve the hosted history and compare SQL before reconciliation; do not use a blanket `db push --include-all`. The September audit recorded migrations `20260830090148` and `20260830140000` as applied without replaying them.

Previously reported adviser notices include authenticated SECURITY DEFINER RPCs, disabled leaked-password protection, overlapping read policies and index notices. Recheck current hosted advisories before operational changes. Password protection and policy/index tuning remain separate follow-up work.
